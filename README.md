# 2025 DoD Cyber Sentinel Challege

The 2025 [DoD Cyber Sentinel Challenge](https://www.correlation-one.com/dod-cyber-sentinel) (Capture the Flag competition) officially begins on June 14 at exactly 11 a.m.  This is my first competition -- I've never competed before, so my plan was to complete the easy questions first, and work my way up to the hard questions.  By focusing on the easy questions, I learn about what type of questions, tools, and rationale I should expect on more difficult questions and how I can use them to solve different types of problems in the competition since I've never seen these types of questions before.  I mainly used tcpdump to analyze pcap data, curl to get web data, and strings for binary files.  

The hints in the easy questions were free and helpful in capturing the flag.  On the medium questions, I used two hints which cost 25 points each.  They were not helpful -- they might have been helpful if I knew more about cybersecurity, so it became clear hints in the medium questions were costly and were not useful.  These required a bit of critical thinking to solve.  

I looked at the hard questions and I was lost, so I didn't even consider answering them.
