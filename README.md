# 2025 DoD Cyber Sentinel Challege

The 2025 [DoD Cyber Sentinel Challenge](https://www.correlation-one.com/dod-cyber-sentinel) (Capture the Flag competition) officially began on June 14 at exactly 11 a.m.  This is my first competition -- I've never competed before, so my plan was to complete the easy questions first, and work my way up to the hard questions.  By focusing on the easy questions, I learn about what kind of questions, tools, and rationale I should expect on more difficult questions and how I can use them to solve different types of problems in the competition since I've never seen these types of questions before.  

On the medium questions, I used two hints which cost 25 points each.  They were not helpful -- they might have been helpful if I knew more about cyber security, and I did just fine not using any hints on the easy questions, so it became clear hints were costly and weren't very useful for me in this situation.

I looked at the hard questions and I was lost, so I didn't even consider answering them.
